* Magnetron: Blocking can push or pull (and damage on contact) enemies depending on where you aim before blocking (up/down)
* Nuke: You know what it does
* Overcharge: Blocking boosts your DMG, ATKSPD and makes bullets explode for a few seconds but large block cooldown increase
* Poseidon: Buckshot but not useless
